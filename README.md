Details
--------

- Customiziable Player limit allows server owners to specify how many players are allowed in the battle royale at once

- PvP kills during the battle royale grant 1 `Bloodshed Token` used as reward currency. 

- Winning a Battle Royale match grants 1 `King's Badge` which is used as premium reward currency.

- Instead of typical zone-style protection, Players will have to interact with relics that appear throughout the match. By interacting with a relic, they will recieve a temporary buff that protects them from the Infection.

- The Infection is Professor Putricide's concoction that has suffocated the air of the battle royale. Without the relic's protection, you'll perish!

- Last player standing wins the battle royale!
